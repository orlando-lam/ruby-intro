# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods.inspect

we_have_to_go_back = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back.inspect

mixed_array = ["tacos", 3, true]
# puts mixed_array.inspect

shopping_lists = [["diapers", "wipes", "bath toys"], ["coffee", "beer"]]
# puts shopping_lists.inspect
# puts shopping_lists.length

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# puts favorite_foods[1]
# puts favorite_foods[2]

puts shopping_lists[1][0]

# Add to the array
# favorite_foods << "more tacos"
# puts favorite_foods.inspect

puts favorite_foods + ["more tacos"]
